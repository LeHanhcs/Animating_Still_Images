Introduction
---
This resposity is the official implementation of our method MAViNet. This paper has been published on ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications. <br>
Unlike the realm of transferring oil painting style, our MAViNet solves the problems of transferring map art styles to video.
